# GifImporter

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that allows you to essentially import gif images. It converts gifs to a spritesheet then adds the appropriate components.

A fork of this mod is also available [here](https://github.com/art0007i/GifImporter).<br>
This fork makes the generated sprite sheets into a almost square resolution, at the cost of some wasted space in certain cases.

1. Place [GifImporter.dll](https://github.com/kawaiiamber/GifImporter/releases/latest/download/GifImporter.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
